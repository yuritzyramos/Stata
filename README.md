### Economic Forecasting 
### Final Project 
For this project, I had to construct a forecasting model for my data of choice. I decided to create a forecasting model for data of employment in manufacturing. Unfortunately, the accuracy of the model was not as precise as previously expected possibly due to changes inflicted to the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
This project demonstrates the following:
* Choosing a forecasting model 
  * Time trend model 
  * Break in the trend 
  * Autoregressive model 
* Graphs of data and fitted values
* Measures of fit (i.e., AIC, BIC, R-Squared)
* White noise test
