### Economic Forecasting 
### Final Project 
For this project, I had to construct a forecasting model for my data of choice. I decided to create a forecasting model for data on [employment in manufacturing from the Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://beta.bls.gov/dataViewer/view/timeseries/CES3000000001;jsessionid=61ACE3D6240A711FDB43D39D25F10920). Unfortunately, the accuracy of the model was not as precise as previously expected possibly due to changes inflicted to the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
This project demonstrates the following:
* Choosing a forecasting model 
  * Time trend model 
  * Break in the trend 
  * Autoregressive model 
* Graphs of data and fitted values
* Measures of fit (i.e., AIC, BIC, R-Squared)
* White noise test
